   DANCED ON SHERE KHAN’S HIDE

   The Song of Mowgli—I, Mowgli, am singing.  Let the jungle
      listen to the things I have done.

   Shere Khan said he would kill—would kill!  At the gates in the
      twilight he would kill Mowgli, the Frog!

   He ate and he drank.  Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou
      drink again?  Sleep and dream of the kill.
