   We lent to Alexander the strength of Hercules,
   The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;
   We bowed our necks to service: they ne’er were loosed again,—
   Make way there—way for the ten-foot teams
         Of the Forty-Pounder train!

   And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;
   Then we come into action and tug the guns again—
