   We haven’t a camelty tune of our own
   To help us trollop along,
   But every neck is a hair trombone
   (Rtt-ta-ta-ta! is a hair trombone!)
   And this our marching-song:
   Can’t!  Don’t!  Shan’t!  Won’t!
   Pass it along the line!
   Somebody’s pack has slid from his back,
   Wish it were only mine!
   Somebody’s load has tipped off in the road—
   Cheer for a halt and a row!
   Urrr!  Yarrh!  Grr!  Arrh!
   Somebody’s catching it now!

   ALL THE BEASTS TOGETHER
