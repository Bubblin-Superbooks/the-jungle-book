<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">them no harm, but they were afraid of me.  Why?

   Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too.  The jungle is shut to me and
      the village gates are shut.  Why?

   As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so fly I between the
      village and the jungle.  Why?

   I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy.  My
      mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but
      my heart is very light, because I have come back to the jungle.
      Why?
