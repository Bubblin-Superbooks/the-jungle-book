It is a very soothing lullaby, and the first verse says:</p><blockquote><p>   Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,
   Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,
   Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,
   From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.
      All things made he—Shiva the Preserver.
   Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all—
   Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
   And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
