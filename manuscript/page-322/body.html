   The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;
   We bowed our necks to service: they ne’er were loosed again,—
   Make way there—way for the ten-foot teams
         Of the Forty-Pounder train!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   GUN BULLOCKS</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Those heroes in their harnesses avoid a cannon-ball,
   And what they know of powder upsets them one and all;
   Then we come into action and tug the guns again—
   Make way there—way for the twenty yoke
         Of the Forty-Pounder train!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
