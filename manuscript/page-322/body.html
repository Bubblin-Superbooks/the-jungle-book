   Battle to the tiger, carrion to the kite,
   And rags and bones to wicked wolves without the wall at night.
   Naught he found too lofty, none he saw too low—
   Parbati beside him watched them come and go;
   Thought to cheat her husband, turning Shiv to jest—
   Stole the little grasshopper and hid it in her breast.

      But this was Least of Little Things, O little son of mine!

   When the dole was ended, laughingly she said,
   “Master, of a million mouths, is not one unfed?”
    Laughing, Shiv made answer, “All have had their part,
   Even he, the little one, hidden ‘neath thy heart.”
