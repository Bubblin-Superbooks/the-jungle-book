<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Road-Song of the Bandar-Log</p><blockquote><p>   Here we go in a flung festoon,
   Half-way up to the jealous moon!
   Don’t you envy our pranceful bands?
   Don’t you wish you had extra hands?
   Wouldn’t you like if your tails were—so—
   Curved in the shape of a Cupid’s bow?
      Now you’re angry, but—never mind,
      Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Here we sit in a branchy row,
   Thinking of beautiful things we know;
   Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do,
   All complete, in a minute or two—
   Something noble and wise and good,
   Done by merely wishing we could.
      We’ve forgotten, but—never mind,
      Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
