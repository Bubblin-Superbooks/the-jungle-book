   I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers’ song—
   The Beaches of Lukannon—two million voices strong.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,
   The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,
   The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame—
   The Beaches of Lukannon—before the sealers came!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I met my mates in the morning (I’ll never meet them more!);
   They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.
   And o’er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach
   We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
