The end nearest the wall, you said?”</p><p>“Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?”</p><p></p><p>“Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly off to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina chase you away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went there now she’d see me.”</p></div> </div>
