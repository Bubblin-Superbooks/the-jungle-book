      I will remember my old strength and all my forest affairs.
   I will not sell my back to man for a bundle of sugar-cane:
      I will go out to my own kind, and the wood-folk in their lairs.

   I will go out until the day, until the morning break—
      Out to the wind’s untainted kiss, the water’s clean caress;
   I will forget my ankle-ring and snap my picket stake.
      I will revisit my lost loves, and playmates masterless!</code></pre><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Kala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the Indian Government in every way that an elephant could</p></div> </div>
