Does he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?”</p><p>“H’sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,” said Mother Wolf. “It is Man.”</p><p>The whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come from every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders woodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run sometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.</p><p>“Man!” said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. “Faugh! Are there not enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on our ground too!”</p></div> </div>
