   Who has delivered us, who?
      Tell me his nest and his name.
   Rikki, the valiant, the true,
      Tikki, with eyeballs of flame,
   Rikk-tikki-tikki, the ivory-fanged, the hunter with eyeballs of
   flame!

   Give him the Thanks of the Birds,
      Bowing with tail feathers spread!
   Praise him with nightingale wordsâ€”
      Nay, I will praise him instead.
   Hear!  I will sing you the praise of the bottle-tailed Rikki, with
   eyeballs of red!
