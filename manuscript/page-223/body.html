<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The Beaches of Lukannon—the winter wheat so tall—
   The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!
   The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!
   The Beaches of Lukannon—the home where we were born!

   I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.
   Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;
   Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,
   And still we sing Lukannon—before the sealers came.

   Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!
   And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe;
