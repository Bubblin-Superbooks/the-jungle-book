      spring.  The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it
      falls.  Why?

   I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet.

   All the jungle knows that I have killed Shere Khan.  Lookâ€”look
      well, O Wolves!

   Ahae!  My heart is heavy with the things that I do not understand.</code></pre><p></p></div> </div>
