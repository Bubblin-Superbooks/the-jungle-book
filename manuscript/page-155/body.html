<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>   Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too.  The jungle is shut to me and
      the village gates are shut.  Why?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   As Mang flies between the beasts and birds, so fly I between the
      village and the jungle.  Why?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy.  My
      mouth is cut and wounded with the stones from the village, but
      my heart is very light, because I have come back to the jungle.
      Why?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the
      spring.  The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it
      falls.  Why?</p></blockquote></div> </div>
