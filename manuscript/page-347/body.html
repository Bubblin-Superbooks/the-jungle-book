<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?”</p><p>“Well,” said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly like a little boy saying a poem, “I don’t quite know whether you’d understand.”</p><p>“We don’t, but we have to pull the guns,” said the bullocks.</p><p>“I know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think you are. But it’s different with me. My battery captain called me a Pachydermatous Anachronism the other day.”</p><p>“That’s another way of fighting, I suppose?” said Billy, who was recovering his spirits.</p><p>“You don’t know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt and between, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what will happen when a shell bursts, and you bullocks can’t.”</p><p>“I can,” said the troop-horse. “At least a little bit. I try not to think about it.”</p></div> </div>
