<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Children of the Camp are we,
   Serving each in his degree;
   Children of the yoke and goad,
   Pack and harness, pad and load.
   See our line across the plain,
   Like a heel-rope bent again,
   Reaching, writhing, rolling far,
   Sweeping all away to war!
   While the men that walk beside,
   Dusty, silent, heavy-eyed,
   Cannot tell why we or they
   March and suffer day by day.
      Children of the Camp are we,
      Serving each in his degree;
      Children of the yoke and goad,
      Pack and harness, pad and load!</code></pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
