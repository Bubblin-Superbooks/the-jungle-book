   Alala!  I have no cloth to wrap me.  The kites will see that I am
      naked.  I am ashamed to meet all these people.

   Lend me thy coat, Shere Khan.  Lend me thy gay striped coat that I
      may go to the Council Rock.

   By the Bull that bought me I made a promiseâ€”a little promise.
      Only thy coat is lacking before I keep my word.

   With the knife, with the knife that men use, with the knife of the
      hunter, I will stoop down for my gift.
