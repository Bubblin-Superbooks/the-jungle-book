Bagheera lay close to Mowgli, and the fire pot was between Mowgli’s knees. When they were all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak—a thing he would never have dared to do when Akela was in his prime.</p><p>“He has no right,” whispered Bagheera. “Say so. He is a dog’s son. He will be frightened.”</p><p>Mowgli sprang to his feet. “Free People,” he cried, “does Shere Khan lead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?”</p><p>“Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to speak—” Shere Khan began.</p><p>“By whom?” said Mowgli. “Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle butcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.”</p></div> </div>
