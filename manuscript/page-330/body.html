I am only a baggage camel of the 39th Native Infantry, and I am not as brave as you are, my lords.”</p><p>“Then why didn’t you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native Infantry, instead of running all round the camp?” said the mule.</p><p>“They were such very bad dreams,” said the camel. “I am sorry.
