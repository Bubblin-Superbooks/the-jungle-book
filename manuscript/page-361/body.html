<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">For to get out of the rain!</code></pre><p>Then I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had come down with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer.</p><p>“Now,” said he, “in what manner was this wonderful thing done?”</p><p>And the officer answered, “An order was given, and they obeyed.”</p><p>“But are the beasts as wise as the men?” said the chief.</p><p>“They obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock, he obeys his driver, and the driver his sergeant, and the sergeant his lieutenant, and the lieutenant his captain, and the captain his major, and the major his colonel, and the colonel his brigadier commanding three regiments, and the brigadier the general, who obeys the Viceroy, who is the servant of the Empress. Thus it is done.”</p></div> </div>
