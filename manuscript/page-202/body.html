   Red-Eye called to Wrinkle-Skin.
   Hear what little Red-Eye saith:
   “Nag, come up and dance with death!”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Eye to eye and head to head,
      (Keep the measure, Nag.)
   This shall end when one is dead;
      (At thy pleasure, Nag.)
   Turn for turn and twist for twist—
      (Run and hide thee, Nag.)
   Hah!  The hooded Death has missed!
      (Woe betide thee, Nag!)</p></blockquote></div> </div>
